The files and their contents are as follows:

**_MITCOVID1_** - Exploratory Data Analysis, fetching, cleaning, exploring the Johns Hopkins University (JHU SSE) Novel Coronavirus (COVID-19) Dataset.

**_MITCOVID2_** - Understanding and modelling exponential as well as logistic growth in case numbers.

**_MITCOVID3_** - Using probability concepts such as Bernoulli processes, Monte Carlo to to understand recovery processes.

**_MITCOVID4_** - Understanding 'Random Walk' or Stochastic Processes.
